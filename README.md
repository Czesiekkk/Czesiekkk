Hey, I am just regular guy who's trying his best at programming with HTML, CSS and JS.

My history or first hit meet with programming was at 2018 when wanted to learn C++ and C# to make games and... just passed.
After years when I've made my way throught the school I was just thinking about start programming websites 'cuz... it was easier.
So I've recently watched tutorials about knowing, understanding and learning websites and started typing.
My goal for the first time was making every day about one page and become fullstack developer.
Here's starting my tour!
